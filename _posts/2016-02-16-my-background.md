As an art history student I discovered the power of visual storytelling, while my experience as an educator taught me that information is only as valuable as it is accessible. I value creating scalable digital products with an eye towards user-centered design.

I feel most energized when I'm working to discover new technologies and methods for solving diverse problems and I'm excited to pursue opportunities to utilize my new technical skills while also building on my prior experience in education and project management. I appreciate working with a mission-driven team and I am looking for opportunities that will allow for continued learning through collaboration.
