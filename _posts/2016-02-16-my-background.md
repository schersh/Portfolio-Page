As an art history student I discovered the power of visual storytelling, while my experience as an educator taught me that information is only as valuable as it is accessible. I value contributing towards scalable digital products with an eye towards user-centered design and community engagement.

I feel most energized when I'm communicating with others to help them discover new technologies and methods for solving diverse problems and I'm excited to pursue opportunities to utilize my new technical skills while also building on my prior experience in education, writing and project management.
